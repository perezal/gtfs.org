## shapes.txt

File: **Optional**

Shapes describe the physical path that a vehicle takes, and are defined in the file shapes.txt. Shapes belong to Trips, and consist of a sequence of points. Tracing the points in order provides the path of the vehicle. The points do not need to match stop locations.

|  Field Name | Required | Details |
|  ------ | ------ | ------ |
|  shape_id | **Required** | The **shape_id** field contains an ID that uniquely identifies a shape. |
|  shape_pt_lat | **Required** | The **shape_pt_lat** field associates a shape point's latitude with a shape ID. The field value must be a valid WGS 84 latitude. Each row in shapes.txt represents a shape point in your shape definition. |
|   |  | For example, if the shape "A_shp" has three points in its definition, the shapes.txt file might contain these rows to define the shape: |
|   |  | `A_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0` |
|   |  | `A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6` |
|   |  | `A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11` |
|  shape_pt_lon | **Required** | The **shape_pt_lon** field associates a shape point's longitude with a shape ID. The field value must be a valid WGS 84 longitude value from -180 to 180. Each row in shapes.txt represents a shape point in your shape definition. |
|   |  | For example, if the shape "A_shp" has three points in its definition, the shapes.txt file might contain these rows to define the shape: |
|   |  | `A_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0` |
|   |  | `A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6` |
|   |  | `A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11` |
|  shape_pt_sequence | **Required** | The **shape_pt_sequence** field associates the latitude and longitude of a shape point with its sequence order along the shape. The values for **shape_pt_sequence** must be non-negative integers, and they must increase along the trip. |
|   |  | For example, if the shape "A_shp" has three points in its definition, the shapes.txt file might contain these rows to define the shape: |
|   |  | `A_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0` |
|   |  | `A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6` |
|   |  | `A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11` |
|  shape_dist_traveled | Optional | When used in the shapes.txt file, the **shape_dist_traveled** field positions a shape point as a distance traveled along a shape from the first shape point. The **shape_dist_traveled** field represents a real distance traveled along the route in units such as feet or kilometers. This information allows the trip planner to determine how much of the shape to draw when showing part of a trip on the map. The values used for **shape_dist_traveled** must increase along with shape_pt_sequence: they cannot be used to show reverse travel along a route.  |
|   |  | The units used for **shape_dist_traveled** in the shapes.txt file must match the units that are used for this field in the [stop_times.txt](/reference/stop-times) file. |
|   |  | For example, if a bus travels along the three points defined above for A_shp, the additional **shape_dist_traveled** values (shown here in kilometers) would look like this: |
|   |  | `A_shp,37.61956,-122.48161,0,0` |
|   |  | `A_shp,37.64430,-122.41070,6,6.8310` |
|   |  | `A_shp,37.65863,-122.30839,11,15.8765` |
